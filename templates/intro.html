    <h1>Ticket Submission System - User Feedback Survey</h1>
    <p>
        Imagine working at a company that has introduced a new, intuitive ticket submission system.
        Now, when you encounter a problem or challenge - perhaps a storage issue, a technical problem
        or a project issue. Instead of searching for the right person or department to assist,
        you simply jot down the details in the form. From there, the system takes charge,
        like a skilled guide, seamlessly directing your request to the team best equipped to resolve it.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this streamlined process, your concerns are not just noted - they are carefully routed
        to ensure swift and effective resolution.
